# Live WebGL Shader Editor
This is a JavaScript library that aims to provide the same functionality as *Firefox DevTools Shader Editor*: modify the source of shaders in real-time, in the browser, without reloading, easy to include and totally implementation-agnostic. Using function hooks to modify the relevant methods of *WebGLRenderingContext*, it's possible to add this features with JavaScript only.

The main idea is to create a *Chrome DevTools extension*. And I have really no idea how to get that done, so if anyone is willing to help, let's do it!
